# 赖世雄语法

语法是基础，需要大量的阅读来巩固语法。

## 1. 句子的基本结构

### 1.1 可以作主语的结构

#### a. 名词、代词

```
Tom is a good man.
He is handsome.
She study very hard.
```

#### b. 动名词、不定式短语

```
Studying english is funny.
To find his dog is impossible.意愿，未发生的事情
It is fun to learn english. 头太大，一般使用it当做形式主语，真正主语改成不定式结构放在后面。
```

但是有些固定结构不使用不定式替换动名词。

```
It is no use crying spilt milk. 覆水难收
It is no use/sense/point in crying spilt milk.
It is useless + to do.
It is of no use + to do.
```

#### c. 名词从句

> 名词性从句包括：主语从句、宾语从句，标语从句，同位语从句。

记忆口诀：戴that慧whether怡what/when...

> 疑问句作主语不需要倒装。
> 主语（头）太长使用it代替。

- that引导的陈述句

```
That she is beautiful is true.
# 但是当名词主语太长时，会头重脚轻，经常用it代替。
It is difficult to understand that he killed a dog.
```

- Whether 引导的一般疑问句

> 一般疑问句：可以使用yes/no来会的的疑问句。

```
Whether he is a good man remain to be seen.
It remain to be seen whether he is good man.
```

- 疑问词引导的特殊疑问句

```
When Tom arrived at school is dubious(可疑的). 作主语
It is still a question what he will do. 使用It
I don't know how he'll handle it. 作宾语
I am worried about whether he can do it. 作介词宾语
# 切记：that从句不能当做介词宾语。
I am sure of the fact that the team has won the game. that从句当作介词宾语必须使用the fact.
I am worried about his playing around all day. 动名词当作介词宾语。
I am worried that he plays around all day. 去掉介词。

```

#### d. 名词短语

由疑问词引导的名词从句演变而来

上面的疑问句改成 to do 形式。但是唯独 why 不可以。

```
When to start it is not decided.
How to do it is difficult.
疑问副词：where to live / whether to try again / when to talk to him / how to do it.
疑问代词：what to do / whom to see / which to buy / whom to talk to。
```

#### e. from to/till 

表示距离/时间的介词短语

```
From Guangzhou to Beijing is a long distance. (其实前面省略了The distance).
It is about 1000 kilometers from Shanghai to Beijing. 使用形式主语it。
From 1900 till 2018 is a long period. （前面省略了time）。
```

### 1.2 动词种类及用法

判断及物动词(vt)/不及物动词(vi)

- 我 _ Ta。  
- Ta被我 _ 。  

放入以上两个句子，通顺就是vt；有一个不通顺就是vi（准确率99%）。

如：love/happen（发生车祸）/run(跑步，经营)... 

#### a. 完全不及物动词

主语+vi，意思已经完整。

用法：1、主语+vi； 2、主语 + be + 现在分词。

```
He Danced.
He was dancing.
I am dancing.
```

#### b. 不完全不及物动词

后面需要补足语，意思才完全。

用法：1、主语+vi+补足语

```
Hi is good. 需要形容词作表语。
become(变成,vi,不适合 “Ta被我 _ ”)
He become a good boy.(vi)
He become knowledgable.
He become handsome.
```

常见的不完全不及物动词：be, become, get(mad/killed)（变成，+消极的词）, turn(pale/yellow)(变成，+颜色)，感官动词(look/sound/smell/taste/feel) ...

#### c. 完全及物动词

加了宾语后，意思完整。

用法：1、主语+vt+宾语； 2、主语+be+doing+宾语(have/love等词没有进行时-中文不能说正在doing)； 3. 主语 + be + 过去分词。

```
I hit him.
He was hit.
I was hitting him.
I make a chair.
```

#### d. 不完全及物动词

加了宾语后，意思依然不完全，需要添加补足语。

```
I make him happy. 使...
I have him do the work. 叫sb做某事
# 叫：make/have sb do; get sb to do; bid(吩咐) sb do(to do 也可);.
# 让:let sb do。（i have a house to let 出租，the rain let up for a few hours 雨停了）
# 迫使/强迫/促使:force/push/cause sb to do
```

#### e. Dative Verbs 授予动词

用法：主语 + 授予动词 + 间接宾语（授予对象） + 直接表语（东西）。 

```
I teach him english.
I gave him a car. 两个宾语（直接宾语+间接宾语）
I gave a car to him. 
I bought him a book.
I bought a book for him.(for 含有代劳的意思)
I mode a chair for him.
I telled him a story/joke.
I lent him some money.
I asked him a question.（固定用法）
I asked a question of him.(不常用)
I expect/require/demand nothing of him.（固定用法，of 含有from的概念）
He robbed(抢劫) me of my handbag.（固定用法，sb放在前面）
The city was deprived of its water supplies.这座城市被断了水。
He eased me of my burden.他减轻了我的负担。
```



### 1.3 五大句型；祈使句、感叹句、问句

#### a. 五大句型

上面的动词的5个种类对应句子的五大句型。这些都是`陈述句`，除此之外还有祈使句、感叹句、问句。

#### b. 祈使句

定义：把主语You及助动词should 或must 省略的句子。句子开头使用原型动词；句尾根据语气强弱使用`句号`或`感叹号`，亦由上面的五大句型演变而来。

```
You must run now. 完全vi
(Don't) Run!
You must be quiet now. 不完全vi+表语
(Don't) Be quiet!
You must open the door now. 完全vt+O
(Don't) Open the door!
You must make him do it. 不完全vt+o+oc
(Don't) Make him do it.
You must send him a letter. 授予vt+间接o+直接o。
Send him a letter.
Don't send him any letters.
# 否定祈使句除了Don't外，还可以使用Never。
```

#### c. 感叹句

定义：由How或What引导。

- What + n + 主语 + 动词 ...!

```
What a beautiful car he has!
What a great man he is!
What a good boy you have made him!
```

- How + adj/adv + 主语 + 动词...！

```
How great he is! 形容词
How Hard he studied! 副词
```



#### d. 问句

问句分为两种：一般疑问句，特殊疑问句。

一般疑问句：不以疑问词开头的问句，可以用yes/no回答。

```
Is he nice?
Could they handle the problem?
Did he leave early?
Doesn't he want it?
Isn't he happy?
# 回答：无论是哪种一般疑问句，肯定=yes；否定=no
```

特殊疑问句：以when what where why how who whom which 等开头的问句，不能用yes/no回答。

```
Where will you go?
Why did he cry?
Who is he?
Whom/who he saw then?  # 美语中常用who代替whom。
---------
What/Who/Which 三个疑问词可以当作名词，可以直接放在居首，而无需采用倒装结构。
Who came?
What (has) happened?
Which was broken?
```

## 2. 两个句子的连接

### 2.1. 连接符号

bash(-), colon(:), semi-colon(;)

```
He is versatile-he speaks five different languages and plays the piano very well.
He has finally made his goal known to us:he wants to be a scientist.
He is nice;quite often he is seen helping others.
```

### 2.2. 并列连词

and, or, but 介词短语等

基本的并列连词有三个： and or but, 可用于连接对等的单词，短语或句子。

```
He enjoys taking picture, and he has decided to pursue(从事，追求) the art as his life career.
He and I enjoy singing.
He is kind and handsome.
Is he sad or happy?
He doesn't like her but hates her.
---
I came to see him and (to) tell him the truth.
He is not good at English but poor at it.
---
He works hard, and his father is proud of him.
Did he fail because he was lazy or because he was careless?
I like John, who is easy to get along with but whose brother is too arrogant(自大) to associate with.
```

虽然基本的连接词只有and, or, but 三个，但是还有其他衍生的连接词。

```
both...and... 一方面...同时...
either...or... 要么是...要么是...
neither...nor... 既非...亦非...
not...but... 并非...而是...
not only...but alse...不仅...而且...
-----
as well as... 以及
rather than... 而非
# 以上两个连接主语时，动词始终随第一个主语作变化。
eg. 
He as well as I is interested in music.连词
He no less than I is interested in music.连词
He together with me is interested in music.介词
He along with me is interested in music.介词
---
He rather than I is interested in music.连词
He instead of me is interested in music.介词
He, not I, is interested in music.连接词
I like this book, not that one.
I like this book rather than that one.
```

使用 as well as...rather than...连接两个连接主语时，动词始终随第一个主语作变化。

使用 both..and...连接两个连接主语时，必须使用复数动词。

使用 either...or.../neither...nor.../not...but.../not only...but alse...连接主语时，则要随最近的主语作单复数变化。

### 2.3. 副词连接词

连词：because, though, if unless, as soon as, once, 等等引导的状语从句。整个状语从句可以是为副词，用来修饰主句。

```
He deserves our respect because he is honest.
Because he is honest，he deserves our respect.
# 状语从句放在主句前面，经常加逗号。
# 两个句子只需要一个连接词，如 because/so though(although, even if, even though)/but(yet) 只能用一个。
```

when, while, once, if, as soon as, unless 可以引导条件句，也可表示将来的状况；当表示将来的状况时：从句一般使用一般现代时（or现在完成时），主句一般使用将来时。

```
When I saw him, I felt happy.  # 写作时，主语相同时，可以变成副词短语。说话时没有必要省略。
When seeing, him I felt happy.
While I Was in Beijing, I had a good time.
While in Beijing, I had a good time. 分词短语中的being省略。
When rich, I will buy a car.
If rich, I will buy a car.
If I have money, I will buy a car. If只能使用be动词的副词短语，一般动名词是错误的。
```

连接性副词:therefor, thus, however，具有连接词的意味，但不是连词，是副词。不能连接两个句子（需要用分号）。

```
He is nice, so I like him.
He is nice; therefor, I like him.
He is nice. Therefor, I like him.
He is nice; I, therefor, like him.
# therefor后面习惯性用逗号，thus后面习惯不用逗号。
He is nice, but I don't like him.
He is nice; however, I don't like him.
# however的使用基本同therefor
```

## 3. 关系词

### 3.1 关系代词

who/whom(代替人), which(代替实物/整个句子)关系词引导定语从句。

如：他是个从不说谎的人，压根就没有“从不说谎”这个单词，so，请使用定语从句。

#### who/whom/which使用原则

1、之前一定要有先行词；

2、关系代词在所引导的定语中要做主语、宾语或表语；

3、否则关系代词之前一定要有介词。

```
He is a good student who studies hard.
He is a boy whom everyone loves.
He is a man with/for whom I enjoy working.
He is a man whom I enjoy working with/for.# 有些固定短语不宜将介词前置，如：call on/pay attention to
He is a man I enjoy working with/for.
```

#### (非)限制性修饰

关系代词前面有逗号表示**限定修饰**，无逗号表示**非限定修饰**。

```
He is my father, who love me very much. 
# father是唯一的，不需要后面的定于从句。后面的从句可以不需要。
He is a teacher whom I respects. #他是那个我很尊重的老师。
# 其他的如Dave/The Station等大家都知道的人/物(专有名词)都应该使用非限定修饰。
```

#### that也可以当作关系代词

that可以在某些情况取代who/whom/which，条件是：

1、that前面不能有逗号；

2、that前面不能有介词。

有些情况下只能使用that，而不能使用who/whom/which：

1、最高级 + 名词

2、the very/only... + 名词

3、序数词后(the + first/second.../last...)

4、all/everything等之后

5、句子中有两个相同的关系代词引导的定语从句，第二个使用that

6、用在be动词后做表语，只能使用that

7、其他

```
He is the best student that I've ever taught.# 不能用whom
He is the very man that I met yesterday.
He is just the man that I met yesterday.
He was the first man that came up with such an idea.
All the students that are studying here are harrdworking.
All/Everything that he said is true.
He works hard, which is a fact that is known to us.
Who is the boy that is talking to Tom? # who/is/the
He is not the man that he once was. # is/the
Look at the boy and the dog that are coming this way. # boy&dog
He is a man who I think never lies. # I think 为插入语，不影响前面使用主格who。 
# 类似的插入语还有：I find/Think 等
```

### 3.2 关系代词所有格

所有格：你的/我的/他的

关系代词所有格：whose(人/物)，也是引导定语从句。

使用原则同前一节。

```
This is Mr Wang whose doctor is my GF.
I bought this book whose content is interesting.
I hate John, whose words are seldom true.
I hate John, whose words I don't believe.
I hate John, whose words I have no trust in.
```

取代whose的结构

```
I bought this book whose content is interesting.(简单的多)
I just bought a book, the content of which is interesting.
I just bought a book, of which the content is interesting.
```

### 3.3 关系副词

where（=介词+which）,when（=介词+which）,why（=for which）,how(=in which)

```
I born in Nanjing in which I met Mary.
I born in Nanjing where I met Mary. 当名词为地点时，使用 where 代替 介词+名词；
He came on Friday, when it was raining very hard.
I don't know the reason why he cried.
I don't know why he cried. # 疑问词引导的名词从句。
That's how he handled the thing. # how 不能和 the way 共存
That's the way he handled the thing. # 同上一句，中间省略了"in which"。
```

### 3.4 准关系代词

than, as 和but，前面有先行词时，才是准关系代词。

than作为准关系代词：than等于“than + the + 前面的名词 + 关系代词”；

```
I have more money than you (do). # 省略了 "the money which"
I have more money than (is) needed.
I have more money than he need.
```

as作为准关系代词：as等于 "as + the + 前面的名词 + 关系代词"

```
He has as much money as I (do).
I don't like such a man as tells lies. # 作为主语，等同于“as the man who”
In our company there is not such a man as David (is). # 作为be动词的表语。
I have the same book as is laid on the desk. # 等同于“as the book which”
I have as good a dictionary as you (do). # as + adj. + n. + as...
```

but作为准关系代词：只用于 “no + noun.”之后；此时的 but 等于 “关系代词  ...not”

```
There is no one who is not interested in it.
There is no one but is interested in it. # 等同于上句
There is nothing but he knows. # 没有他不知道的事。
There is nothing but he can do. # 没有什么事情时他做不来的。
There was no one whom he didn't hate. # 没有什么人是他不讨厌的。
There was no one but he hated. #同上
```

## 4. 非谓语动词

由动词变化而成，一共有三种：

a. 不定式：`to do `

b. 分词：现在分词（doing）和过去分词（done）

c. 动名词：`doing`

> ```
> 动名词和现在分词虽然形式一样,但从本身词性来说,动名词顾名思义,属名词词性,所以在句中要充当名词能作的成分,常作主语/宾语/定语/表语.
>
> 现在分词(表主动/进行),属形容词词性,充当形容词能作的成分,常作表语/定语/状语/补语.
>
> 所以可以从-ing形式作的成分来确定它是动名词还是现在分词.如果-ing形式是作主语/宾语的,那肯定就是动名词了.如果是作状语/补语,那肯定是现在分词.
>
> 至于动名词和现在分词都可以作的成分定语/表语,需要具体去区别(现在分词表示主动/进行,作定语时表示与被修饰词是主动关系.动名词作定语时表示被修饰词的用途.).
> ```

### 4.1 不定式

```
To study abroad is my dream. # 作为名词，表示未发生的。
I want/hope/expect/plan/... to mary her. # 作为宾语，前面的动词常是意愿/计划等;anticipate例外（使用doing）。
I have something to do. # 作为形容词。sth 必须作为do的宾语
She give me sth to remember him by. # 作为形容词，
Please give me a pen to write with. # 作为形容词，
I have no place to go/live (to/in). # 老外也把 to 省略了。
I come to see her. # 作为副词。
to pleasure her, I sing a song. # 作为副词。
You may go if you want to (go). # 前面已经有go了，习惯省略。
```

**原形不定式**：就是原形动词，通常出现在助动词后面；如：`can/could/shall/should /will/would/may/might/ought to/must`.

**知觉动词** + `原形不定式`，作为宾语补足语，表示已经发生的事实。

> 直觉动词后面可以使用：原形不定式do（看到某人。。。了）， 动名词doing（看到某人人正在。。。）， 过去分词done（表示被动的`I feel my hand touched`）

看：see, watch, observe, look at, notice.

听：hear, lesten to

感觉：feel

```
I saw him enter the room.
I felt the house shake. # 我感觉到房子在摇晃了。
```

**使役动词** + `原形不定式`

常用的使役动词：let（让）, make（使）, bid（叫）, have（叫）,get等。

```
I make him wash the car.
He was made to wash the car. # 被动时需要使用 to do 。
I had/get（把） my car washed. # 表示被动时，使用过去分词。
```

其他

```
He assisted her to find employment. 他帮助她找工作
Their presence would assist in keeping the peace. 他们在那儿将有助于维护和平。
Help me (to) do the work.
He help me with the work.
do nothing but + do
choose/expect/want/desire nothing but + to do
I have no choice/option but to apologize.
be interested in nothing but + doing
enjoy nothing but + doing
cannot but + do  忍不住...
cannot help but + do 忍不住...
cannot help + doing 忍不住...
```

### 4.2 分词

#### 现在分词 + 过去分词

```
现在分词：
--------
	单纯式：doing
	完成式：having done
	被动式：being done
	完成进行式：having been doing
	完成被动式：having been done
过去分词：
--------
	done
```

分词在句中可以表示 正在进行、完成、被动 语态的概念，即，进行式/完成式/被动式

#### 分词当作形容词

现在分词：形容词，翻译：“令人/正在/即将。。。的” interesting, exiting, confusing, aging, 

过去分词：形容词，翻译：“感到/已经。。。的” exterested, exited, confused

#### 分词当作补足语

- 如果是 vt ，后面无宾语，使用done；后面有宾语，使用doing。
- 如果是vi， 当作宾语补足语时，一定用doing。

```
I found him killed.
I found him killing a girl.
I found him waiting Mary.  vi
I found her setting in the corner.  vi
He was walking to me with one hand holding a knife.  情状副词短语
He was walking to me with a knife held. 
He was walking to me pipe in mouth.   # 托福考试原题-叼着烟斗
He was talking to me with his leg shivering. vi作为介词
```

#### 分词当作名词

其实是形容词，比如 `the rich`表示 `这一类有钱的人`。

```
The rich are not necessary happy. 有钱人未必快乐
The wounded were sent to hospital immediately. 伤员被立即送往医院
The unexpected happened. 意外发生了。
```

#### 分词当作副词

```
It is freezing/biting cold today. 刺骨的冷
Tea is boiling hot.
An estimated 54 people were killed in the air crash. 估计
He is dead wrong. 完全地completely
The answer is doubtless correct. 毫无疑问正确
```

#### 分词结构

句子中有两个动词，需要使用连词（and/but...）；

没有连词时，两个动作同时方式，第二个动词使用doing。

```
He studied very hard but failed the exam.
He worked very hard and won the honor.
He came home crying. 
He sat in the corner reading a newspaper.
He came home (being) tired. 省略being
```

### 4.3 动名词

动名词的形态和现在分词完全一样；但是不同的是：动名词具有本质是名词，具有名词的特性，可以作主语/表语/表语。

#### 名词性功能

```
Working with him is fun. 作主语
It gives me great pleasure to help others.  # It 后面需要使用不定式
It is no use Crying over spilt milk. # 固定用法
His hobby is collecting stamps. 作表语。
My hope is to fulfill the mission. 表示未发生的事情。
Some people do not enjoy smoking. 作宾语。
# 动名词作宾语的动词有：condider contemplate imagine fancy avoid risk escape deny admit stop quit suggest recommend mind remember finish practice anticipate等等
He is fond of taking a walk. 介词的宾语。
```

#### 所有格与动名词的关系

```
His teaching well is something that pleases me.
His not finishing the work on time desappointed me.
Their having helped John with the work won our great admiration.
# 表示喜欢/厌恶/在意等及物动词不能使用that引导的表语从句。
如：I don't like that he smokes here. 是错误的；可以使用：
I don't like his smoking here.
# 另外：That从句也不可以当作介词的宾语。
I am curious about his staying up late every night. 不能使用that从句。
In spite of the sun shining, the air was very cold. 主语是“物”，不使用所有格。
```

#### 与名词组合成复合名词

```
a sleeping car. 用来睡觉的车厢-动名词。 名词性质
a sleeping baby. 正在睡觉的baby-现在分词。 形容词性质
```

#### 常用动名词习惯用语

```
There is no reasoning with such a stubborn man. 和这么固执的人理论是不可能的。
# 等同于 It is impossible to do...
It is no use trying to escape.
Cannot help/stop/resist doing 忍不住，还有 refrain from doing.
# 等同于 cannot but do 或者 cannot help but do.
On/Upon hearing it, he cried. 一听到。。。就。。。
```



## 5. 助动词及易用错的词
